                        Today we'll learn more on combining selectors and the
                        different types of units.

                        <li>
                            First, we'll have some time to work on the Upside-down
                            Tetris exercise.

                        <li>
                            Then we have the Box Model - Margin Drills
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After a short break, we'll have a demo on combining
                            selectors followed by a kahoot on CSS Selectors to
                            English Review.

                        <li>
                            Then we'll have our Containers and Selectors Drills
                            followed by a powerpoint on Responsiveness Part 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We'll nd class with a demo on Absolute vs Relative
                            Units.

                            &mdash; You can see stars as they were 4,000 years 
                            ago with the naked eye. Without a telescope, 
                            all the stars we can see lie within about 4,000 
                            light-years of us. That means at most youâ€™re seeing 
                            stars as they were 4,000 years ago, around when the 
                            pyramids were being built in Egypt.
