                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jun Kazama (風間 準 Kazama Jun?) is a character in the 
                        Tekken series who made her debut in Tekken 2. She is the 
                        mother of Jin Kazama, having raised him alone after 
                        failing to save Jin's father, Kazuya Mishima, from 
                        Devil's influence. Jin presumes she is dead after 
                        witnessing her being attacked by Ogre on his fifteenth 
                        birthday, at a time when Ogre was attacking and killing 
                        participants of the second King of Iron Fist Tournament. 
                        Jun's official status, however, is "missing".[3] She has 
                        had multiple cameos and references in every mainline game 
                        following Tekken 2 despite not canonically returning as 
                        a playable character until Tekken 8. In the non-canonical 
                        Tekken Tag Tournament 2, after being defeated in Arcade 
                        Mode, Jun transforms into Unknown, the final boss.

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not much is known of Jun's personality aside from the 
                        few hints that other characters have given throughout 
                        the series; for example, Kazuya describes her as 
                        "mysterious" in his Tekken 6 prologue. Jun seems to 
                        embody tranquility and purity and is shown to have a 
                        peaceful and animal-loving nature. This is evident in 
                        her mission to save Kazuya from the corruption of Devil
                         in Tekken 2, the forest animals' natural affinity 
                         towards her (shown in her Tekken 2 and Tekken Tag 
                         Tournament 2 endings), her choice of vocation as an 
                         animal welfare officer, and her ability to suppress 
                         the Devil Gene (as hinted at by Angel's presence in 
                         Kazuya, as well as in her Tekken Tag Tournament ending, 
                         and during her special tag win-pose with Devil Jin in 
                         Tekken Tag Tournament 2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jun is someone for whom spirituality is important. After 
                        coming to Tokyo for her work, she became disillusioned 
                        being so far from nature, only becoming renewed in her 
                        dedication after she was visited by the ghost of her 
                        father. Her Tekken 2 profile describes her as being able 
                        to 'commune' with nature, and that her meeting with her 
                        dead father helped her understand paranormal phenomena. 
                        Her desire to save Kazuya is always referred to in 
                        spiritual terms and she has some psychic or empathetic 
                        abilities of her own.

                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jun is one of the tallest women in the Tekken series. 
                        She has shoulder-length black hair and brown eyes. She 
                        has bangs that frame her face, and wears a white 
                        headband or scarf in her hair. She often has a 
                        monochrome palette, wearing clothes of white and black, 
                        emphasizing her purity of character. She wears 
                        functional clothes, usually associated either with her 
                        work as a WWWC officer, or martial arts training gear.

                    <h3>Tekken 3</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jun taught and trained Jin her Kazama self-defense fighting style. Years later, Jun sensed the approaching of great evil and told Jin that if anything should happen to her, that he should seek out his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jun's words proved to be prophetic, and sometime after Jin's fifteenth birthday, Ogre did indeed attack. Jun screamed for Jin to run away, but Jin wished to protect his beloved mother and prepared to fight Ogre in order to save Jun. Ogre, however, was too much for Jin and knocked him unconscious. What happened next is unknown, but by the time Jin woke up, the Kazama house was burnt to the ground and Jun was missing. Jin desperately searched for her, but she was nowhere to be found or seen. Jin assumed that Jun was dead and swore revenge on Ogre.[9]
