        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz package Medjool Date</li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup peanut butter, thick and creamy
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup melted semi-sweet, milk, or dark chocolate
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup chopped peanuts
            </li>
            <li>Flakey sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
                Cut the Medjool dates open down the middle and remove the pit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the Medjool date down on the parchment paper, with the 
                inside facing down. Repeat with the rest of the dates making 
                sure they are tightly packed side by side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread on a thin layer of peanut butter on top. You can pop it 
                in the fridge at this step or just continue to the next step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second
                 intervals on low power. Mix between each interval until fully 
                 melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the chocolate over the peanut butter and use the back of a 
                spoon or rubber spatula to spread it into a thin layer.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle on chopped peanuts and flakey sea salt.</li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until the chocolate 
                is set and firm to touch.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge and transfer to a cutting board.</li>
            <li>
                Cut the bark into equal sections. You can make the squares as 
                small or as big as you'd like.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy now or store in an air-tight container in the fridge!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>TIPS & NOTES</h3>
        <p>
            You can make the date bark as large or as small as you like 
            depending how many dates you spread out.

            The measurements are also estimates, feel free to use as much or as 
            little of every ingredient as you'd like.
